# AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant

## Overview
The **AI-Powered Healthcare Assistant** is a machine learning-based application designed to assist users with healthcare-related queries. This project utilizes **Streamlit** for the user interface, **NLTK** for natural language processing, and **Hugging Face's FLAN-T5** model for generating responses. The goal is to provide users with reliable and AI-driven health-related insights.

## Features
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands user queries related to healthcare.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses Hugging Face's **FLAN-T5** model for generating responses.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for an interactive and easy-to-use UI.
- **Efficient Query Handling**: Processes and responds to healthcare-related questions in real time.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for the web app interface)
- **NLTK** (for text processing and tokenization)
- **Hugging Face FLAN-T5** (for AI-generated responses)
